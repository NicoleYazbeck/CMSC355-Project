## Introduction: Using AI in Coding
Artificial intelligence in the world of software engineering raises both concerns and hopeful expectations for the future. As AI continues to advance, we quickly learned that AI can process and develop code faster but as accurately as the human mind. However, this questions the jobs of software engineers will be overtaken and replaced by AI. Found by research from the article, “AI And The Future Of Coding”, thirty percent of all coding has already been developed by AI. On the other hand, many deny this theory, as they believe that some code requires more creative, less generic writing. Most codes that need human attention cannot be skewed or at risk through AI generated works because of the lack of security. But aside from these different opinions, we know for a fact that because AI has become more accessible to the public; many can develop and gain opportunities from simple technical software coding AI can produce. As of now, we can only watch AI grow and see where the future of technology according to AI takes us.

## State-of-the-Art Research: AI Tools Applied to Coding
As artificial intelligence continues to shape the future of software development, state-of-the-art AI research tools are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in coding. These tools go far beyond code generation, they now offer advanced reasoning, real-time collaboration, multi-modal inputs and even the ability to process natural language alongside code. For example, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro integrates enhanced post-training with step-by-step problem solving, enabling it to handle complex coding challenges more efficiently. Microsofts’ 365 Copilot introduces “deep reasoning” agents like Researcher and Analyst, which support data-heavy tasks and Python-based analysis, bringing AI closer to functioning like a full-stack developer or data scientist. Meanwhile, DeepSeek V3 has emerged as a global competitor, showcasing impressive advancements in both reasoning and coding precision. These cutting-edge tools demonstrate that AI is not just an assistant, but a transformative force, streamlining workflows, accelerating development cycles, and redefining the role of the human coder. As research continues to advance, we can expect even more intelligent, adaptive tools that blur the line between human creativity and machine-generated solutions.

## Important Tools
There are a myriad of AI tools out there for software developers which work to streamline development and assist developers in creating high-quality software projects. In this section, we are going to focus on three of those tools and compare their strengths and their weaknesses. First, we are going to discuss ChatGPT. This conversational AI assistant is one of the most widely used AI tools across various fields. ChatGPT surpasses other models when it comes to providing developers with thorough code explanations. This model is a go-to when you just need quick information on external libraries or need a more in-depth understanding on a piece of code that may look confusing or intimidating starting out. One major pitfall when using ChatGPT, is its inability to flow seamlessly with the development process. It can be quite annoying to have to go to and from the coding editor when you need assistance. The next AI-powered tool we are going to talk about is Tabnine. This tool works seamlessly with numerous IDEs making it an ideal choice for developers. Tabnine excels at auto-completing functions, identifying potential errors and generating test cases in order to help developers create more efficient and accurate code. However, its chat functionality is sometimes not very accurate and it can have trouble implementing proper error handling in its auto-completed functions. Additionally, the test cases often lack complexity which can mean they need more human refining and enhancements. Another important AI-powered coding tool that deserves a mention is GitHub CoPilot. This tool has many helpful capabilities to aid in the development process from auto-completion to test case generation. It is very similar to Tabnine in its functionality, however, it has been known to provide more thorough and accurate responses when it comes to error handling and test case creation. However, like many AI-powered assistants even if it provides a correct solution it may not always be the most effective solution. In conclusion, all of the tools discussed work to improve the efficiency and quality of a developers time, however, as a developer it is important to always evaluate code given from AI coding assistants to determine if it will fit the needs of your program.

## Emerging Tools
There are numerous emerging AI tools used to transform the coding industry by enhancing productivity and automating various aspects of software development. Some tools include Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro which is an advanced AI model that excels in reasoning abilities by combining “a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training.” It processes tasks step-by-step and makes more informed decisions by supporting multi-model inputs like text and code. Microsoft 365 Copilot’s Researcher and Analyst Agents are “deep reasoning” AI agents that assist in research and data analysis tasks. “Researcher” relies on OpenAI’s deep research AI model to pull off “complex, multi-step research.” It does this by integrating data from various sources, while “Analyst” processes raw data and executes Python code; which allows it to function like a data scientist. Another tool is DeepSeek’s V3 Model. This is a Chinese AI model that has rapidly emerged as a “notable player” in the global AI landscape in recent months. They’ve accomplished this by showcasing significant improvements in reasoning and coding capabilities. Tools like these, and more, are crucial for code optimization/quality improvement, automated debugging/error detection, faster learning/skill enhancement, enhanced collaboration/documentation, etc.
