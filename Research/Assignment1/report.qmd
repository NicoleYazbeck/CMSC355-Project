## Introduction: Using AI in Requirement Definition
In today's fast-paced software development and business environments, defining clear and precise requirements is critical to project success. Traditional methods of requirement gathering often suffer from ambiguity, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies, leading to costly revisions, misalignment with business goals, and project delays. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping this process by automating requirement extraction, improving clarity, and enhancing collaboration across teams.  
As highlighted by Modern Requirements and Ambassador Labs, AI-powered tools leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze stakeholder inputs, detect inconsistencies, and suggest refinements. These technologies streamline requirement elicitation, classification, validation, and prioritization, ensuring that specifications are more accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with business objectives. Additionally, AI-driven insights into quality metrics, impact analysis, and traceability enhance real-time collaboration, allowing distributed teams to work more efficiently and make data-driven decisions with confidence. 
By integrating AI into the requirement definition process, organizations can minimize errors, accelerate development cycles, and ensure compliance with industry standards. This transformation not only optimizes project outcomes but also empowers teams to focus on strategic innovation and problem-solving, ultimately driving greater efficiency and success in software development.  

## State-of-the-Art Research: AI Tools in Requirements Definition
Many state-of-the-art tools for requirements definition leverage AI. These tools use natural language processing and automation to improve accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in Requirements Engineering. Modern tools for requirements definition include IBM Engineering Requirements Management, Aqua, and Visure. These tools streamline requirement gathering, traceability and collaboration. AI-powered tools, such as Chat-GPT-based assistants and NLP-driven tools, assist in extracting, analyzing and validating requirements from textual data. These advancements reduce ambiguity, improve compliance and accelerate developmental cycles allowing requirements definitions to be more precise and user-friendly.
IBM Engineering Requirements Management is widely used in complex systems engineering projects, offering a wide range of traceability, change management, and compliance capabilities. This software enables teams to manage large scale requirements effectively while aligning their work with industry standards. IBM Engineering Requirements Quality Assistant allows for AI-powered quality assistance and compliance checking. Aqua is a requirements management solution which provides AI-enhanced traceability and automation. Visure offers advanced natural language processing abilities, AI-powered requirement traceability, and AI-powered requirements validation. These tools are all combined with AI-driven enhancements that optimize requirements definition by reducing errors, improving consistency and enhancing project efficiency.

## Important Tools
The use of Artificial Intelligence has erupted in popularity, changing the way people interact with technology, access information, and obtain content. AI tools are commonly used to answer questions, generate pictures/videos, and assist with tasks. Popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Synthesia, and Grammarly are used globally, each offering their service differently through their strengths and weaknesses. 
To start off, ChatGPT uses natural language processing to create human-like dialogue. It receives a question or statement by input and outputs essays, articles, emails or a simple response. The ability to engage in conversations and write in various different writing styles is a key strength to ChatGPT. Its capability to assist with written data makes it an attractive AI tool to students, writers, and professionals. However, despite its useful functionalities, several complaints by its users consisted of incorrect or outdated information. 
Similarly but more specifically, the AI tool, Grammarly, helps its users to improve their grammar, clarity and spelling in their essays. They target more specifically on enhanced literature and scans for plagiarism rather than receiving broad questions to answer. The primary downside to Grammarly is its reliance on predefined grammar rules which can lead to incorrect suggestions. Despite its inaccuracy at times, it is still widely used by students and authors who find the platform effective. 
In contrast to ChatGPT and Grammarly, the AI tool, Synthesia, specializes in video generation and editing. It transforms text into video with virtual characters using improved deep learning networks. Its ability to create content that sounds natural is a beneficial tool for marketers, teachers and content creators. The users of Synthesia can save time, money, and resources using their platform but may be restricted in the long run due to its limited customization. 
With a variety of AI tools that are accessible to the public, each consists of their strengths and weaknesses that make it their own. Depending on the project, one may strive over one program rather than the other. In the end, these AI tools are created to help the public embrace their artistry through technology which may be counter intuitive due to its quick attempt at human-like creations that take away creative thinking.


## Emerging Tools
Emerging tools applied to requirements primarily focus on using natural language processing to automate tasks such as requirement gathering, prioritization, traceability, and analysis. This allows for a faster and accurate capture of needs while minimizing the chance of human errors. These emerging technologies include features such as natural language understanding, requirement classification and tagging, consistency and conflict detection, recommendation engines, and chatbot based requirement gathering. The key benefits of using these AI emerging tools are increased efficiency by freeing up time for more strategic activities, improved accuracy by reducing human error through identifying inconsistencies, enhancing collaboration through facilitating easy communication, and an overall faster time to market by streamlining the requirement gathering process and thus leading to a faster development cycle.
